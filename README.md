  Two-thousand on thermometers
  Two-thousand surroundin' us
  Travel two-thousand kilometers
  To hang out with us
  What's up, danger? (Danger)
  What's up, danger? (Danger)
  Ayy, gettin' old, they doubted us
  Makes it that more marvelous
  Sign 'em up, 'cause I'm in this vibe and I get synonymous
  What's up, danger?
  Ayy, don't be a stranger
  'Cause I like high chances that I might lose (lose)
  I like it all on the edge just like you, ayy
  I like tall buildings so I can leap off of 'em
  I go hard wit' it no matter how dark it is
  I'm insane but on my toes
  I could keep the world balanced on my nose
  I had a slumber party wit' all my foes
  Now I wear 'em like a badge of honor all my clothes
  If I'm crazy, I'm on my own
  If I'm waitin', it's on my throne
  If I sound lazy, just ignore my tone
  'Cause I'm always gonna answer when you call my phone
  Like, what's up, danger? (Danger)
  Like, what's up, danger? (Danger)
  D-don't be a stranger
  What's up, danger?
  Two-hundred miles-per-hour wit' a blindfold on (on)
  Mama always askin', "Where did I go wrong?" (wrong)
  What's up, danger?
  Ah, what's up, danger?
  Traveled two-hundred miles, I'm knockin' at your door
  And I don't really care if you ain't done wrong, come on
  What's up, danger? (Danger)
  D-don't be a stranger (stranger)
  I like it when trouble brews, I won't dare change
  I like it when there's turbulence on my airplanes
  I like it when I sense things I can't see yet
  Swimmin' with sharks when they ain't feed yet
  'Cause I like high chances that I might lose
  I like it all on the edge just like you, ayy
  I like tall buildings so I can leap off of 'em
  I go hard wit' it no matter how dark it is
  If I'm crazy, I'm on my own
  If I'm waitin', it's on my throne
  If I sound lazy, just ignore my tone
  'Cause I'm always gonna answer when you call my phone
  Like, what's up, danger? (Danger)
  Like, what's up, danger?
  Can't stop me now
  I said, "I got you now"
  I'm right here at your door
  I won't leave, I want more
  What's up, danger?
  Yeah, what's up, danger?
  Can't stop me now, yeah
  I said, "I got you now"
  Come on, what's up, danger?
  Come on, I said, "What's up, danger?"
